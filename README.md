# Transformer Model Implementation in PyTorch

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the **Transformer model** in PyTorch, encompassing the essential components required for sequence-to-sequence tasks. From **Layer Normalization** for stabilizing training to **Multi-Head Attention Blocks** capturing global dependencies, and **FeedForward Blocks** facilitating non-linear transformations, each element contributes to the model's expressive power. The inclusion of **Positional Encoding** ensures sequence order awareness, while **Residual Connections** aid gradient flow, reflecting an amalgamation of cutting-edge techniques in deep learning research. The **Encoder** and **Decoder Blocks**, along with the **Projection Layer**, orchestrate the flow of information through the network, enabling effective processing of input sequences and generation of output sequences. The `build_transformer` function serves as the blueprint for constructing the Transformer model with configurable parameters, empowering practitioners to customize and experiment with various model configurations tailored to specific tasks and datasets. In essence, this implementation establishes a robust foundation for leveraging Transformer-based architectures in natural language processing and beyond.
